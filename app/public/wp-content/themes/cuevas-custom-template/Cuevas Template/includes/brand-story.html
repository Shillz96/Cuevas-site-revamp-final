      <h3 class="brand-story-title">The Cuevas Legacy</h3>
      <p>Founded in 1978 by Manuel Cuevas, a master craftsman with deep roots in traditional western bootmaking, our family-owned business began with a small workshop in San Antonio, Texas. Manuel's vision was simple yet profound: create authentic western footwear that honored the traditions of the American West while embracing innovation and exceptional quality.</p>
      <p>For over four decades, we've stayed true to our founding principles, combining time-honored techniques with modern comfort and durability. Each pair of Cuevas boots is crafted with meticulous attention to detail, using only the finest leathers and materials sourced from trusted suppliers who share our commitment to quality.</p>

Implementation Notes for WordPress:
1. This component should be created as a template part in the theme, e.g., 'template-parts/brand-story.php'
2. Images should be replaced with proper WordPress theme paths using get_template_directory_uri()
3. Content should be made editable via the WordPress Customizer or ACF fields
4. Timeline items could be implemented as a repeater field in ACF for easy editing
5. Brand values could also use a repeater field to allow adding/removing values
