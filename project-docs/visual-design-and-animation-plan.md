## GSAP Animation Strategy

### 1. Performance-Focused Approach

- Prioritize performance over flashy effects
- Optimize animations for mobile devices
- Use GSAP's performance tools to monitor and optimize

### 2. Brand-Appropriate Animations

- Subtle, elegant animations that reflect western aesthetic
- Avoid overly modern or tech-focused animations
- Animations should enhance, not distract from products

### 3. Core Animation Types

#### ScrollTrigger Animations

- Parallax effects for background elements
- Reveal animations for content sections
- Sticky elements for important information

#### Hover Animations

- Product card hover effects
- Button and link hover states
- Menu item hover interactions

#### Transition Animations

- Page transitions between main sections
- Modal opening/closing animations
- Form step transitions

#### Micro-Interactions

- Form field interactions
- Add to cart button animations
- Success/error message animations

### 4. Implementation Approach

#### Setup GSAP in the Theme

```javascript
// GSAP Core
import { gsap } from "gsap";

// Plugins
import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";
import { Draggable } from "gsap/Draggable";
import { CSSRulePlugin } from "gsap/CSSRulePlugin";

// Register plugins
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, Draggable, CSSRulePlugin);
```

#### Animation Modules Organization

Create modular animation files:
- `animations-home.js` - Homepage animations
- `animations-products.js` - Product page animations
- `animations-cart.js` - Cart and checkout animations
- `animations-global.js` - Global elements (header, footer, etc.)

#### Sample Animation Snippets

Hero Banner Parallax:
```javascript
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: ".hero-section",
  start: "top top",
  end: "bottom top",
  scrub: true,
  animation: gsap.to(".hero-background", {
    y: 100,
    ease: "none"
  })
});
```

Product Card Hover:
```javascript
const productCards = document.querySelectorAll('.product-card');
productCards.forEach(card => {
  const image = card.querySelector('.product-image');
  const details = card.querySelector('.product-details');
  
  let tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
  tl.to(image, { scale: 1.05, duration: 0.3 })
    .to(details, { y: -10, opacity: 1, duration: 0.2 }, 0);
  
  card.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => tl.play());
  card.addEventListener('mouseleave', () => tl.reverse());
});
```

## Responsive Design Considerations

### Mobile-First Approach

- Design for mobile screens first
- Adapt animations for touch interactions
- Consider data usage and performance

### Adaptive Animations

- Simplify animations on mobile devices
- Use media queries to adjust animation properties
- Consider disabling certain animations on low-power devices

### Testing Strategy

- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Monitor performance metrics (FPS, CPU usage)
- Get user feedback on animation feel

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Set up GSAP and basic animation framework
2. **Week 2**: Implement global animations (header, navigation, footer)
3. **Week 3**: Develop homepage animations
4. **Week 4**: Create product page and category page animations
5. **Week 5**: Implement cart and checkout animations
6. **Week 6**: Optimization and cross-browser testing

## Animation Best Practices

1. **Accessibility**:
   - Respect user preferences for reduced motion
   - Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
   - Maintain sufficient contrast during animations

2. **Performance**:
   - Animate GPU-friendly properties (transform, opacity)
   - Batch animations where possible
   - Use GSAP's force3D option for better performance

3. **User Experience**:
   - Keep animations meaningful and purposeful
   - Maintain consistency in timing and easing
   - Avoid animations that delay user interaction
